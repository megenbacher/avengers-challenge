                <h2>PETER PARKER</h2>
                <p>In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City,[49] Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. 
                    As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit
                    and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid".[50] Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. 
                    Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his 
                    new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star.</p>
